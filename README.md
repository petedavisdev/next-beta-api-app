# Next beta API app

This is an experiment in using Next.js 13 beta with the app directory and React server components and api routes.

## Done...

1. ✓ Create a new repo from my starter [petedavisdev/next-ts-starter](https://github.com/petedavisdev/next-ts-starter)
2. ✓ Use Thunder Client to test api calls
3. ✓ Create an api route to provide paginated episode data
4. ✓ Add character images to api results
5. ✓ Create a page and display the data for page 1
6. ✓ Add a next/previous links and dynamic routes to display data for other pages
7. ✓ Create and style the components to show item data

## Todo...

8. Prevent paging past the end of the results
9. Error handling for fetch responses
10. Responsive styling for smaller screens
